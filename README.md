# Calgary_Climate_Analysis
My current ongoing project, I have been interested in analysing data with respect to weather to identify changes in weather and temperature patterns.
This repo includes all the datasets used along with my jupyter notebooks.

The questions I want to answer in my analysis are:

RAIN
- What can we learn from the patterns of rain in the last century, how have these changed over time? 
- How much does rain impact floods, and moreover, does it seem to be one of the causes? (regression)

TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE
- How have the distributions of temperature and moisture changed since the oil boom?
- Do we have any data on pollution that we could use to attempt to find patterns between moisture and pollution?
- How have these factors impacted forest fires, particularly, the rate at which they occur, their intesity, and the span of time they last

NATURAL DISASTERS
- With the help of research, when natural disasters occurred, how did these weather patterns change?
